# Project Context: Crafting Interpreters in Kotlin and Zig

## Overview

I am implementing Robert Nystrom's "Crafting Interpreters" book. Key language choices have been made:
1.  **Part I (Tree-walk interpreter):** Using **Kotlin** instead of Java. The project is named **`klox`**.
2.  **Part II (Bytecode VM):** Using **Zig** instead of C. The project is named **`zlox`**.

I have completed the Kotlin implementation (`klox`) and we are just starting the Zig implementation (`zlox`).

This is my first time using Gemini CLI so please provide tips an tricks for optimal use.
