  - Scanner error messages now include proper periods and formatting
  - Compiler error messages for local variables and loop limits corrected
  - Runtime error messages match expected output exactly
- Addition operator properly handles both string concatenation and arithmetic operations
- Stack overflow handling fixed by changing stack_top from u8 to u16 to prevent wraparound
- Various operator error messages corrected to match expected output
- Fixed compiler error message formatting for consistency with reference implementation

### Added

### Technical Achievement
- **First Complete Compatibility**: This marks the first chapter where our Zig implementation achieves 100% compatibility with Robert Nystrom's comprehensive test suite
- **Test Suite Integration**: Successfully integrated with https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters test framework
- **Enhanced Implementation**: Two tests intentionally ignored due to our enhanced features:
  - `test/limit/too_many_constants.lox` - We support 2^24 constants instead of 2^8 limit
  - `test/limit/no_reuse_constants.lox` - We implemented constant reuse optimization beyond reference

### Quality Milestone
This release represents a significant quality milestone where our implementation not only matches the functionality of the reference implementation but also demonstrates enhanced capabilities while maintaining full backward compatibility. All 132 applicable tests from the official test suite now pass, confirming our implementation's correctness and robustness.

- Negate operation optimized to modify stack top in-place
- Enhanced error handling for stack operations with `StackUnderflow`
- VM initialization now requires allocator parameter

### Technical Details
- Dynamic stack growth eliminates fixed 256-element limitation
- Each challenge demonstration properly scoped with defer cleanup
- Stack operations use ArrayList methods for bounds checking
- Memory-efficient stack reuse between VM executions

## [0.15.0] - 2025-08-01

### Added
- Chapter 15 - Virtual Machine implementation
- Complete stack-based bytecode virtual machine (`VM` struct)
- Arithmetic operations: `Add`, `Subtract`, `Multiply`, `Divide`, `Negate` opcodes
- Stack management with 256-element capacity and overflow protection
- Runtime error handling with `InterpreterError` types
- Binary operations with proper operand ordering (left/right)
- Division by zero error checking
- Configurable execution tracing via build option (`-Dtrace=true`)
- Stack visualization during trace execution
- Line number tracking integration with VM execution

### Changed
- Value type changed from `u64` to `f64` for floating-point arithmetic
- Main function now executes bytecode via VM instead of just disassembling
- Line number types standardized to `u24` throughout codebase
- Build system enhanced with trace configuration option

### Technical Details
- VM uses instruction pointer (`ip`) for bytecode navigation
- Stack pointer (`sp`) manages operand stack with bounds checking
- Binary operations pop two operands, compute result, and push back to stack
- Long constants (24-bit indices) fully supported in VM execution
- Trace mode shows instruction disassembly with line numbers and stack state

## [0.14.1] - 2025-07-27

### Added
- Optimized line number encoding using offset-based skiplist instead of run-length encoding
- Long Constant challenge implementation supporting constants beyond 256 limit
- `ConstantLong` opcode for handling 24-bit constant indices
- Efficient line number tracking with `CodeLine` structure storing chunk offset and line number

### Changed
- Modified `Chunk.writeByte()` to no longer require line parameter
- Updated `Chunk.writeConstant()` to automatically choose between `Constant` and `ConstantLong` opcodes
- Refactored line number storage from `ArrayList(usize)` to `ArrayList(CodeLine)`
- Enhanced disassembler to properly handle both constant instruction types
- Removed 256 constant limit in `ValueArray.writeValue()`

### Technical Details
- Line number encoding now uses skiplist approach: only stores line changes with their chunk offsets
- Constants beyond index 255 use 3-byte encoding (24-bit) via `ConstantLong` instruction
- Disassembler tracks line numbers efficiently during instruction iteration

## [0.14.0] - 2025-07-27

### Added
- Chapter 14 - Chunks of Bytecode implementation
- Basic bytecode chunk structure with opcodes
- Value array for constant storage
- Debug utilities for disassembly
- Initial `Constant` and `Return` opcodes
