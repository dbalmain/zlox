### Chapter 30 Optimization Notes
This implementation corresponds to Chapter 30 of Crafting Interpreters focusing on memory optimization.
The first optimization (hash table improvements) was skipped since Zig's built-in `HashMap` implementations
already provide excellent performance characteristics. This C-style object refactoring provides the primary
memory optimization benefits outlined in the chapter with dramatic improvements in memory efficiency.
