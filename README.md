# zlox

A Zig implementation of the Lox programming language from Robert Nystrom's "Crafting Interpreters".

This project implements the bytecode virtual machine from Part II of the book, written in Zig for performance and learning purposes.

## Current Status

- **Chapter 17**: Compiling Expressions - ✅ Complete
  - Complete Pratt parser implementation with precedence climbing
  - Full expression compilation for arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)
  - Unary minus operator and parenthesized grouping support
  - Integrated compiler-VM pipeline with proper error handling
  - Expression parsing with correct operator precedence and associativity

## Building and Running

```bash
# Build the project
zig build

# Run the REPL (interactive mode)
zig build run

# Run a Lox file
zig build run -- script.lox

# Run with trace output (debug VM execution)
zig build run -Dtrace=true

# Run tests
zig build test
```

## Project Structure

- `src/main.zig` - Main executable entry point with CLI interface
- `src/scanner.zig` - Lexical analyzer for tokenizing Lox source code
- `src/compiler.zig` - Pratt parser compiler for expressions with precedence handling
- `src/vm.zig` - Virtual machine implementation
- `src/chunk.zig` - Bytecode chunk representation
- `src/value.zig` - Value types and operations
- `src/debug.zig` - Disassembler and debugging utilities
- `src/root.zig` - Library module exports
- `build.zig` - Zig build configuration

## Learning Goals

This implementation focuses on:
- Understanding bytecode virtual machines
- Zig language features and idioms
- Memory management in language implementations
- Performance-oriented interpreter design
